# 18: No matter how fancy your printer is, know how to fix it. 
Why:

I know. They’re awesome. I love my Prusa MK4S. It's super reliable, but I could still take the entire thing apart and put it back together without a manual. When a wire comes loose, a belt slips, or the hotend clogs, you’ll need to know how to fix it. 

> [!TIP]
> You probably don’t need to know how to build a printer in a cave with a box of scraps, but learn some maintenance and cleaning practices. Keep some spare parts too for quick turnarounds. 

Maintenance and repairs might require some disassembly.

So unleash your inner "Serial Designation N” and get to work.
