# 21: Don’t trust a perfect person and don’t trust a bot that’s flawless. Honest.
Why: This is a line from the song “Lane Boy” by Twenty One Pilots with the word “Song” replaced for “Bot.” It still holds though.

> _Get it!?!? Commandment 21? I’m so funny._

“Perfect” is a lie made up by big Palm Beach to sell more bot kits.
