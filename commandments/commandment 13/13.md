# 13: Maximize K (Kinetic Energy). Thank me later.
Why: The more kinetic energy your weapon has, the more damage you’ll do. 

Here's where a really complex equation for calculating rotational kinetic energy would go. I did terrify a few people. I then taunted them, asking them if they were ready to quit.

Heh.

I actually made a script to calculate that, as calculating that by hand requires some pretty insane calculus. Instructions can be found inside this folder

> Kinetic energy (At least in the rotational form) is a function of rotational inertia and angular velocity (spinning speed) squared. Rotational inertia is a function of mass and radius squared.
