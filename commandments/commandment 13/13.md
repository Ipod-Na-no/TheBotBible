# 13: Maximize K (Kinetic Energy). Thank me later.
Why: The more kinetic energy your weapon has, the more damage you’ll do.

I actually made a script to calculate kinetic energy, as calculating that by hand requires some pretty insane calculus. Instructions can be found inside this folder.

> Kinetic energy (At least in the rotational form) is a function of rotational inertia and angular velocity (spinning speed) squared. Rotational inertia is a function of mass and radius squared.

> Asymmetric spinners are weaker than Symmetric spinners on paper, but Asyms. have their own advantages, such as better handling, more concentrated torque, and flipping capabilities for Asym. Verticals.

I don’t recommend Asymmetric spinners for your first bot. They are notoriously difficult to balance and design while still maintaining high energy.
