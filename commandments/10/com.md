# 10: “The Brow” and “Solder Saver” are sacred. Do not speak of them in vain,

Why: “The Brow” was the one of the two BattleBots we brought to the chapter’s first competition, with the other being “Cheese Scallion.” “The Brow” managed to outmaneuver one of the best bots (3rd in the league at the time) using only the rotation of the weapon for movement. “The Brow” won.

“Solder Saver” was a BattleBot that participated at SLC 2025. It used the guts of an RC car instead of bespoke electronics. It became the “Underdog” at every match it fought in. Every team collectively cheered them on.

> Side note: I mentioned “Cheese Scallion.” That was my first bot. 
> It was Not Great™, but ended up becoming the precursor to Flarejump and Afterburner. Parts of Cheese Scallion still exist in Flarejump’s files.
>
> Go figure.

> Just because Cheese Scallion wasn’t a great bot, doesn’t mean it wasn’t a great learning experience. A lot of the skills and wisdom I have now came from mistakes I made while working on Cheese Scallion.
