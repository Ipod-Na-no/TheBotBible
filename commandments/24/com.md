# 4: Fusion is the destroyer of worlds. Treat it with respect. 
Why: If you’ve got 200 parametric features and you change one, say goodbye to your computer, as it’s going up in flames.

This can also happen with models with a lot of faces, such as those created from raw STLs.

My PC’s beefy. Fusion’s been the only program capable of freezing my entire machine.

> [!TIP]
> This is very likely to happen with large parametric models. Switch to direct, and only use parametric when absolutely required, such as when balancing an Asymmetric Spinner.
