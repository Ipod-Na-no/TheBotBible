# 12: If you are having nightmares about BattleBots, it’s a sign. I called it “Flarejump.”
Why: This happened to me. I designed Flarejump MK1 the following day. I was… inspired?

I was also thoroughly frightened.

If you’ve got an idea, whether that be in class, in the car, or in a dream, document it.

This doesn’t apply to just BattleBots. This applies to any aspect of life.

Maybe it’s a neat project idea. One of my unrevealed projects is based on a shower thought.

Maybe it’s a solution to a problem. I thought of the SkillsUSA master document in class.

You could have the next Ramanujan–Sato series on your hands.
