# 05: Friction fits aren’t real, nor is glue. Use screws.
Why: During my first competition cycle, I didn’t think that the weapon needed to be screwed in. I used friction and glue and hoped it would hold.

I was wrong.

VERY wrong.
> [!TIP]
> Even when using screws, consider adding threadlocker to screws going in metal, such as hub grub screws. 222 (Purple) works very well. 242 (Blue) works too, but is often a bit overkill. 262 (Red) is just a bad idea. 
> Also consider using square nuts or brass inserts for screws going into plastic. It reduces the chances of your lid flying off mid match. Also allows you to use threadlocker.

Keep friction and glue for your “5-Minute Crafts” sessions. Keep them far away from Bots.
