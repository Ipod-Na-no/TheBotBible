# 03: Twist your wires BEFORE you solder with UNLEADED solder.
Why: Did you know? Lead isn’t great stuff. Although a bit trickier to work with, unleaded solder is much safer. If your soldering skills aren’t up to snuff, twist the wires together beforehand. This ensures a stronger connection and will hold even if your solder job fails.

Also makes it easier to solder them together in the first place.
