# 04: Remember your controller.
Why: Picture this: The state competition is today. You board the bus with your bot. You look out the window, nervous about the competition to come. You disembark and retrieve your bot. You notice something missing. Your controller. You’re heartbroken.

Don’t do what I did. It wasn’t fun.

If you get smoked, you at least still get to participate.
