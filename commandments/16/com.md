# 16: Practice driving BEFORE the competition.
Why: I’ve seen this one far too often. A team will spend every last moment working on their bot, barely finishing before the competition. 

And then they lose when they get outmaneuvered.

I personally like playing something I call “Bot soccer”. Get a filament box or something and some tennis balls. Put the balls into the box and repeat. It’s an excellent maneuverability exercise. 

Sparring with another team (without weapons) is also a good choice and helps identify poor electronic connections.

> Good driving can propel a mediocre bot to the podium, while bad driving can kill a masterpiece.
