# 25: Whatever you do, DO NO—
Why: I looked through my notes, but I couldn’t find the interpretation. I found some scribbles on the margin that might work.

> It's supposed to say do not feed a BattleBot after midnight.

> Eh. It's probably fine.

> Not again…

> If I tell them this one, I’ll have to write a commandment for them.

> Listen to the Regional at Best version of Trees. It’s horrible.

> Name your bot “The Quacken.”

> Break the laws of physics. It voids your warranty.

> Attempt to reason with a BattleBot. I tried. I failed.

> Leave your BattleBot unattended. It’s judgmental. At least Afterburner is.

> Someone said the synth in “Burnin’” sounds like a zipper. I can’t unhear it now. Thanks.
