# 25: Whatever you do, DO NO—
Why: I looked through my notes, but I couldn’t find the interpretation. I found some scribbles on the margin that might work.

> _It's supposed to say do not feed a BattleBot after midnight._

> _Eh. It's probably fine._

> _Not again…_

> _If I tell them this one, I’ll have to write a commandment for them._

> _Listen to the Regional at Best version of Trees. It’s horrible._

> _Name your bot “The Quacken.”_

> _Break the laws of physics. It voids your warranty._

> _Attempt to reason with a BattleBot. I tried. I failed._

> _Leave your BattleBot unattended. It’s judgmental. At least Afterburner is._

> _Someone said the synth in “Burnin’” sounds like a zipper. I can’t unhear it now. Thanks._
