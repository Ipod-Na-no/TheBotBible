# 02: Iconography is important. Make your bot distinct and watch your opponents cower.
Why: Your bot should look like something. Make it stand out. People will remember it and fear it.  Good branding alone has won me a few matches.

Your bot should have an unforgettable name. Lace your opponents with trauma and nightmares. It’s not flair. It’s warfare of the mind.
