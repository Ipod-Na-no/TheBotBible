# 06: METRIC METRIC METRIC. PLEASE. 
Why: 

Imperial is disgusting. What is this half an inch and two-thirds of an elbow nonsense?

I’ve lived in the US my entire life. I still hate them. 

Using Imperial for bots is like building a house while using a block of cheese as your ruler. Sure, you could do it… maybe. But it’s just a bad idea and will probably get you kicked off the construction site.

> [!TIP]
> BattleBots parts and tools are calibrated in metric units. Parts want metric screws and have drawings in metric measurements. The League weighs bots in grams. It makes it easier to coordinate everything if you stick with metric.


> [!CAUTION]
> Mixing up a quarter of an inch and a quarter of a millimeter is a 25x difference.

> **Don't do it.**
