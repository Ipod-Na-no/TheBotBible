# 08: Safety glasses. Wear them. You’re not too cool for them.
Why: You hate them until you have a 50g hunk of plastic hit your eyebrow at 50m/s. Then you realize how close you were to losing your vision.

Needless to say, I wear them now.

“Oh, I’ll be aware when it could happen”

Good luck with that.
