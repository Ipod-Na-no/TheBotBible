# 11: Don’t print anything important the day before the competition.
Why: There’s some sort of heavenly construct that makes 3D printers fail the day before the competition. I don’t know how, but it’s just not a good idea.

Printing spares on the last day is ok, but at least one copy should be ready to go at least 3 days before the competition.
