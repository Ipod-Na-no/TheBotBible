# The Bot Bible™

Welcome to the centeral hub for all things BattleBots!

## This Repo exists so:
- Knowledge can be passed down from graduates
- Teams don't have to reinvent the wheel (...again)
- Dumpster fires are kept to a minimum

## What this Repo is:
- Open-source documentation for everyone, regardless of skill, team, or time
- A way to build standards across teams and to unify the chapter
- Tips, tricks, experiences, and guides
  
## What This Repo Is NOT
- Where I hid Afterburner's design files. Cry me a river
- A place to ask questions. Go to the Discord server for that
- Instructions on how to build a perfect bot. Check Commandment 21


# The Twenty-five Commandments:
- 01: Don’t use Mini Terminals. Just don't. Ever. Don’t even think about it.

- 02: Iconography is important. Make your bot distinct and watch your opponents cower.

- 03: Twist your wires BEFORE you solder with UNLEADED solder.

- 04: Remember your controller.

- 05: Friction fits aren’t real, nor is glue. Use screws.

- 06: METRIC METRIC METRIC. PLEASE. 

- 07: DO NOT put water on a LiPo fire!

- 08: Safety glasses. Wear them. You’re not too cool for them.

- 09: The arena is hungry.

- 10: “The Brow” and “Solder Saver” are sacred. Do not speak of them in vain,

- 11: Don’t print anything important the day before the competition.

- 12: If you are having nightmares about BattleBots, it’s a sign. I called it “Flarejump.”

- 13: Maximize K (Kinetic Energy). Thank me later.

- 14: Log your work in some way. 

- 15: Fumes = Not good. Avoid them. Printing PLA and PETG does not release fumes. ABS does.

- 16: Practice driving BEFORE the competition.

- 17: Remember your heat shrink before you solder.

- 18: No matter how fancy your printer is, know how to fix it. 

- 19: TBA

- 20: TBA

- 21: Don’t trust a perfect person and don’t trust a bot that’s flawless. Honest.

- 22: Never test a weapon in your hand.

- 23: Before a match, double-check everything. EVERYTHING.

- 24: Fusion is the destroyer of worlds. Treat it with respect. 

- **25: Whatever you do, DO NO—**     ㅤㅤㅤ
