# Setting up your controller
This guide regards setting up a Flysky I6 or I6X for a BattleBot. 

>[!WARNING]
>This guide does not cover setting up a Flysky CT6B or an I6X modified with OpenI6X.

>[!NOTE]
>The term "I6" will be used in respect to both controllers. Setup is nearly identical for both flight controllers. Any differences in the setup process between them will be noted.

## Receivers
The I6 is compatible with AFHDS 2A receivers. The most popular for bots are the FS2A and the IA6B.

### The FS2A
The FS2A is the gold standard for antweight combat robotics. 

Pros:
- Super small and light (2 grams fully loaded)
- Simpler binding process
- Lower power requirements
- Cheap
- Available in several mainboards, cutting even more weight.
  
Cons:
- Fewer channels (4 instead of 6)
- No telemetry
- No servo control

For most spinner bots, the FS2A is simply the perfect receiver. In a competition where every gram is precious, the FS2A allows you to spend more of your weight budget where it matters.

However, for less standard spinners and flippers, the FS2A can be limiting. For them, the IA6B may be a batter choice.

### The IA6B
The IA6B is a more capable alternative to the FS2A. 

Pros:
- All 6 channels can be used
- Telemetry support
- IBUS and PPM control lines
- Servo support
- Can be modded for Voltage telemetry
  
Cons:
- Heavy (5 times heavier than the FS2A)
- Annoying to bind
- A bit more expensive
- Needs more power

The IA6B is much more capable than the FS2A, but the extra features don't make up for the extra weight for most bots. 

Flippers take advantage of its servo control capabilites, while heavily customised bots like Afterburner utilize it to take advantage of custom firmware and electronics.

Most bots are better off using the FS2A, saving valuable weight in doing so.

>[!TIP]
>Three variants of the IA6B exist: The IA6, The IA6B, and the IA10B
>
>The IA6 is horrible. It's SO BAD. They hardly even work! Stay away from these!
>
>The IA6B is the best choice out of the three. Reliable, fully featured, and balanced.
>
>The IA10B is usually unnecessary. You don't need 10 channels for Antweights. If for some reason you do, it's a fine choice. Keep in mind that the IA10B needs an I6X to function correctly.

## Getting started with the I6
Both I6 controllers require 4 AA batteries to function. They tend to last a while while running the stock I6 firmware. 

>[!TIP]
>Get some good, high quality batteries and make sure they're not low before competing.
>
>Maybe bring some spares...

The controller can be turned on with the power switch on the front.

>Baby steps... this is probably the most difficult part of the hobby...
